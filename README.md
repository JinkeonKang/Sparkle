In Section III-A, (p, q) two probabilites for differential property of Alzette were  calculated.

Table 2. Success ratios in the experiments for reduced Alzette with the block size b = 16, 24, and 32.

|  b (block size in bits) | p | q |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 16  | 37,020 / 100,000 |  62,252 / 100,000|
| 24  | 3,728 / 10,000 | 6,376 / 10,000 |
| 32  | 393 / 1000 | 642 / 1000  |
